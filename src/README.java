    The program asks you to put in the player who is playing to know what array to look at.
    The program then asks you to put in the index to start from
    NB: This index should be any number from 0 to 5 but should not be a hole that has no pebbles in it.
    That is, you cannot start from a hole with no pebble in it.
    As the program is running, it will be computing the scores of each person and redrawing the board.

    I plan on telling the program when to stop the game and based on the scores computed so far, determine the winner
    I also plan on giving the program some sound whose intensity depends on the number of pebbles in the index and color the board with the pebbles
